MTB BANK is a commercial bank in Ukraine, founded on November 5, 1993, as the open joint stock company Marfin Bank. Since June 2017, the bank has been managed by board chairman Yuriy Kralov and supervisory board chairman Igor Zgurov.
The bank was rebranded and renamed as the public joint stock company MTB BANK in 2017. It operates under License of the National Bank of Ukraine No. 66, dated 19 March 2018. The authorized capital of MTB BANK PJSC is ₴635 million, and its equity is ₴953 million. The total assets of MTB BANK are ₴18.34 billion. MTB BANK serves as an authorized bank of the Pension Fund of Ukraine and is headquartered in Odesa, in southern Ukraine.
MTB Bank was established by the decision of the Constituent Assembly on 15 September 1993 and was registered by the National Bank of Ukraine on 5 November 1993, under No. 207 as the interregional joint stock bank MiDO. Between the 1990s and the 2010s, the bank underwent a series of name changes, becoming Mortorgbank in November 1994, Marine Transport Bank in January 1996, Marfin Bank in July 2010, and most recently MTB Bank in December 2017. Such changes did not affect the organizational and legal form of management of the bank and did not require the termination of the bank as a joint stock company according to the Ukrainian legislation in force at the time of the changes.
